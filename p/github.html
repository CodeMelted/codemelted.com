<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p><strong>Docker Server Suite:</strong> Performed systems engineering for a project.  The system is a suite of Docker container images (some custom builds, some from Docker repository) joined with a Python flask gateway application.  Users can completely access services via a custom web application.  Part of the systems engineering was a refactor of the installation process to allow for upgrading aspects of the system instead of a full installation.  Other parts include identifying user stories to bring this to a deliverable project hosting within the cloud or on physical hardware along with establishing the existing design and creating a coding standard for scripts.  Scripts to perform other tasks were written within Python and bash with a set coding standard for those.</p>
<p><strong>User Database Migration:</strong> An air conditioner company was migrating their cloud-based system from AWS to GCP solution.  Part of this migration was the moving user / device data from Xively database to a Firebase Cloud Firestore.  A TypeScript utility was written to make API calls from the old AWS endpoints to transfer the data into the Firebase Cloud Firestore system.</p>
<p><strong>Django Endpoints and Test API Framework:</strong> Part 2 to the Django Demo Capability is the establishment of API endpoints and the ability to validate those endpoints for non-degradation / performance testing.  The API endpoints were developed in Django Python interfacing with business logic working with a Postgres database.  API documentation was auto generated via <a href="http://swagger.io">swagger.io</a>.  Finally, all documentation hosting, Django admin pages, and the demo application completely share a custom look and feel for a light and dark theme.  The Test API Framework was developed in Python 3 CLI app utilizing the requests and tabulate python modules.  The framework was compiled into an executable to work on Mac OS/ Windows OS.  The framework would utilize JSON test input files to validate expected returns from API calls along with measuring how long the calls took.  This was summarized in a metrics report.  All of this was to support the Django Endpoints into other systems the client was supporting.</p>
<p><strong>Django Demo Capability:</strong> Upgraded a Django web application hosted in the Google Cloud Platform to have a dynamic demo capability for on-stage expos.  This demo required a facilitator on stage to utilize the web application to demonstrate the web applications features while supporting ~500 concurrently connected audience members.  This required an architecture upgrade for the Django to utilize the ASGI protocol via the Channels framework.  Once upgraded, a web socket protocol was utilized to facilitate the demo capabilities.  The web application supported mobile and desktop views, D3 chart rendering, accessing a mobile device camera from the web application, and OCR capabilties via the Google Vision API.</p>
<p><strong>Jeep Pi Explorer v1:</strong> This is a Raspberry Pi 3 Camera Module project that provides the ability to capture photos from within a SUV.  The project has three primary goals.  The first is the capture of the photos, tagging them with GPS and time information.  The second goal is the management of those photos by being able view, delete, share, and move the photos from the SD card to other storage means.  The third goal is access to entertainment items to enjoy while camping in those remote areas. The system is developed using Python 2/3 technologies to access aspects of the Raspberry Pi system with an embedded web app to support the camera capture features.  The &quot;share&quot; feature of the photos is a Phase 2 item of the Extreme Explorer area.</p>
<p><strong>QT Framework Evaluation:</strong> Performed a technical evaluation of the QT C++ framework for building desktop and mobile applications to provide a singular code base and user interface experience.  Wrote a procedure with resource links to setup a QMake project and successfully build an application for those operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>JUCE Framework Evaluation:</strong> Performed a technical evaluation of the JUCE C++ framework for building audio applications.  The technical evaluation was to determine how easily one could build user interfaces to target mobile and desktop applications.  Identified available trainings and built several custom components utilizing the framework.  Documented the findings in a technical report that will allow other software developers to train and identify the strengths &amp; weaknesses of the JUCE framework as compared to other frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Audio Renderer:</strong> Written in C++ 17 utilizing the Qt Framework for the user interface.  Ran on the Windows 7/10 and Mac OS operating systems.  Worked on building a custom user interface utilizing Qt widgets.  Widgets were highly customized for the clients look &amp; feel requirements.  Utilized the Qt Designer Plugin Architecture to allow the customized widgets to be dragged &amp; dropped with the Qt Designer Tool.  Widget customization included overriding behaviors, custom paint events, and heavy emphasis on QSS.  Another side task with this client was the research into QML.  Created two prototypes utilizing QML as the frontend.  The first was a “pure” QML frontend providing a thin C++ communication layer to allow for interacting with the QML.  The second was providing integration of the custom widgets with QML but providing the same C++ communication mechanism as the widgets</p>
<p><strong>Unmanned Aeria Vehicles (UAV):</strong> Written in C/C++ with QT framework support.  Ran on Windows and Linux OS.  Supported Army operators in the field for surveillance and search missions. Worked on modifications to the ACE video payload module for uploading external data files from a Windows laptop.  Worked on prototype for emergency transponder broadcasting when loss of communication occurred</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Checklist Aide (ECA):</strong> Worked on a team that built an automated electronic checklist aide program for the army operator for flight prep, operations, and landing of the UAV. This project consisted of a generator program for the checklist stored as XML and used by the checklist program. The checklist program utilized multiple sockets to interface with other programs to determine if they successfully completed steps as part of the UAV operations. A library was utilized by both applications for the data model, threading, and logging facilities. 100% functional / conditional test coverage accomplished with QTest and Bullseye</p>
<p><strong>British Tank System:</strong> Work on a modernization effort for British tank system as part of the communications team. Five development teams make up the overall effort consisting of 180 modularized DLL projects at roughly 500,000 SLOC. The technologies utilized C++ 11 modernization wrapping legacy COM objects performing the legacy mission. Subsystems developed included: 1) Message rules routing for email messages that were communicated via the radio network, 2) Chat templates facility utilizing QT and XML to support chat operations, 3) Redesigned the Chat Gateway Stack responsible for sending/receiving messages via XMPP on a radio NET, and 4) Redesigned the MILCAN BUS to communicate for GIS information about the tank’s position and speed</p>

<p><strong>Global Windows Provisioning:</strong> Aided the System Administration team in developing a series of PowerShell scripts forming a framework for installing software (COTS, custom, security updates) to support the Defense Information System Agency (DISA) hardening of multiple Windows OS platforms worldwide. Skills from this endeavor provided the capability for the Software Engineering team to develop installation packages from custom application and build simulation/test capabilities utilizing the .NET platform</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Storage Unit (ASU) Upgrade:</strong> The MGS is an older mobile system that utilized 8MM tapes to load the software system.  The tape drives were dying, and the government procured the Advanced Storage Unit (ASU) to replace the tape drives. Led a team of five Software Engineers, one Systems Engineer, one HW/Network Engineer, and two Test Engineers to deploy the ASU. This required an update all site procedures from utilizing 8MM tapes to utilizing the ASU. Use case analysis of both operations/maintenance procedures yielded three new Java applications and the modification of 1970s mainframe applications to communicate via TCP/IP. This was to allow for the development/deployment of a Java virtual tape library server within a WAN accessible by the modified mainframe programs and a dedicated Java client. The final Java program was a dedicated application for transferring data to and from the ASU/virtual tape library</p>
<p><strong>MWDCS Application Suite:</strong> Developed a new application for addressing multiple usability and performance issues with four originally developed Java applications on a Windows platform. this required the development of an application bridge to each of the four original Java applications (i.e. turn them into libraries) to maximize code reuse and consolidate the application into a single application view</p>
<p><strong>MGT Communications Application:</strong> Was the creation of a new Java application for the MGS to handle multiple satellite communication interfaces and an Ethernet interface for receiving and transmitting messages. This application required a searchable database and a service to run so the operator could receive data while not being logged into the platform. This effort was a team of three Software Engineers and two Test Engineers with a turnaround time of 6 months and ~18,000 SLOC</p>
<p><strong>GCNM Operator Display Application:</strong> Led a team of three Software Engineers to build a command and status application for server applications within a WAN. This Java application communicated with the server applications over SSL providing user credentials when issuing commands and displaying status of all the server applications. In total, there was four to six active servers within the WAN. The server changes were in C++ requiring the use of OpenSSL, PAM, and implementing SNMP v3</p>
<p><strong>GCNM Toolkit Application:</strong> Led a team of five Software Engineers to implement the GCNM Toolkit application. This application was an offline application providing management and testing of server applications within a WAN. This was a collection of 7 tools that provide log management, server configuration, scenario editing and simulation testing. The other set of tools provided management of the applications many features</p>
<p><strong>GCNM Common Services Module:</strong> Developed a reusable library for the Java applications that wrap many Java APIs into a reusable set of classes between the applications. Some of the features include SSL, Socket transactions (TCP server, client, and UDP), threading, database transactions, XML parsing, and RMI</p>
